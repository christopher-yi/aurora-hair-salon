## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Second portfolio piece showing off more design elements using an eye-catching color palette, CSS transitions, and CSS/Javascript animations.

## Lessons Learned:

Through the use of CSS and Javascript I was able to style this mock-up website much more than my previous one. The development also really tested my knowledge of using floats to positions elements.
